### Tests to be performed on real Apollo


1. Test if home position makes sense
   
2. Choose the MinJerks we want to try out and make sure the velocities are under the constraints
3. Path Tracking for each Joint
4. Different joint groups together (0,1,2) (0,1,2,3), (0,1,2,3,4) -- record data

5. Torque Messsurments (arm stays in place and we measure torques, record data of ball catching)
